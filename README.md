Here's a Docker Compose YAML file that sets up a WordPress site with integrated PHPMyAdmin and Redis. This configuration includes:

- **WordPress** with a database and Redis caching
- **MariaDB** as the database backend
- **PHPMyAdmin** for database management
- **Redis** for caching

```yaml
services:
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:latest
    ports:
      - "9080:80"
    environment:
      - WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=db
      - WORDPRESS_DB_USER=root
      - WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=your_password
      - WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wordpress
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - REDIS_PORT=6379
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
    networks:
      - wordpress_network

  db:
    image: mariadb:latest
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_password
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress
      - MYSQL_USER=wordpress
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    networks:
      - wordpress_network

  phpmyadmin:
    image: phpmyadmin:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    environment:
      - PMA_HOST=db
      - PMA_USER=root
      - PMA_PASSWORD=your_password
      - PMA_PORT=3306
    depends_on:
      - db
    networks:
      - wordpress_network

  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    networks:
      - wordpress_network

networks:
  wordpress_network:
    driver: bridge
```

### Key Notes:
- **`your_password`** is a placeholder; replace it with a secure password.
- The `depends_on` clause ensures services like `db` and `redis` start before `wordpress` and `phpmyadmin`.
- All services are connected to a shared `wordpress_network` for internal communication.
- PHPMyAdmin is accessible at `http://localhost:8080` (assuming the host is running the Docker container).

### How to Use:
1. Save the above as `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the services.
3. Access WordPress at `http://localhost:9080` and PHPMyAdmin at `http://localhost:8080`.

This setup provides a fully functional WordPress environment with database management and caching capabilities.
